# Automatic-Plant-watering-System
It is designed to automate plant watering using sensors, ESP-32 microcontrollers, and IoT technology. It detects soil moisture levels and activates water pumps accordingly, ensuring optimal hydration while minimizing water wastage. The system also allows remote monitoring and control, making plant care more efficient and convenient.
# IoT-Based Automatic Plant Watering System  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Automatic Plant Watering System** is an IoT-based project that automates the process of watering plants using sensors and microcontrollers. It ensures plants receive the right amount of water by monitoring soil moisture levels and triggering pumps accordingly.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Efficient water management  
- Automation for user convenience  
- Optimized plant health  
- Energy efficiency  
- Cost-effective and environmentally friendly  

## 🛠️ Components Used  
- **ESP-32 WROOM-32** (Microcontroller)  
- **Soil Moisture Sensor** (Detects soil humidity)  
- **Mini Submersible Water Pump** (Automates watering)  
- **Single-Channel Relay** (Controls pump operation)  
- **Temperature Sensor** (Monitors environmental conditions)  
- **9V Batteries** (Power source)  

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ **Automated Watering** – Detects soil moisture and waters plants accordingly.  
✔️ **Remote Monitoring** – Users can monitor and control the system via IoT.  
✔️ **Water Efficiency** – Prevents overwatering and reduces water wastage.  
✔️ **Energy-Efficient** – Optimized for low power consumption.  

## 📷 How It Works  
1. The soil moisture sensor checks the moisture level.  
2. If the soil is dry, the relay activates the water pump.  
3. Once the soil reaches the required moisture level, the pump stops.  
4. Users can remotely monitor and control the system via IoT.  

## 🔧 Installation & Setup  
1. Connect all components as per the circuit diagram.  
2. Flash the provided **.ino** code to the ESP-32 using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.  
3. Power up the system and ensure connectivity.  
4. Test the setup by drying the soil and observing the pump activation.  

## 📈 Future Improvements  
- **Solar-powered system** for sustainability.  
- **Portable design** for wider usability.  
- **Cloud integration** for advanced monitoring and analytics.
